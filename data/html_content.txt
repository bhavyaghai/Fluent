      <p class="text-justify">
        Hi !!! I am a PhD Candidate working with <a href="http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mueller/" target="_blank">Prof. Klaus Mueller</a> in the Computer Science Department at <a href="https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/home" target="_blank">Stony Brook University</a>. I love crunching numbers & developing interactive systems to tackle high impact social problems. Recently, I was awarded with <a href="https://iacs.stonybrook.edu/opportunities/scholarships/junior-researcher-award" target="_blank">IACS Junior researcher Award</a> for my upcoming research on tackling Algorithmic Bias through human centered AI. Last year, I was awarded with Bloomberg Immersion fellowship. As a part of the fellowship, I worked with a non-profit, <a href="http://www.matriculate.org/about-matriculate" target="_blank">Matriculate</a>, and built a real time dashboard to enhance their decision making. As Data Science for Social Good fellow at <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Tech</a>, I got the opportunity to work with <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~ewz/Welcome.html" target="_blank">Prof. Ellen Zegura</a>. I and my team tried to counter housing injustice by analysing Atlanta's anti-displacement policy & communicating its possible impacts. I also worked as a research intern at <a href="http://www.iitd.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi</a> where I tried to predict solar radiation to ensure power supply-demand equilibrium. Previously, I completed my Bachelorâ€™s & Masters in Information Technology from <a href="https://iiitm.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Information Technology, Gwalior</a>. For my master's thesis, I worked on ensemble learning and recommender systems under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3zztZKMAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Anupam Shukla</a>. I am also the recipient of Chairman Fellowship Award from Stony Brook University (2016). <br/><br/>
